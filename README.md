# Implemented Functions
- Our data is from TMDB api, and we use firebase as our backend for the comment system.
- Users choose to either create their own account by email or use their social account like Facebook and Google to log in. 
- Keep the log in session, until the browser is closed, which means refresh the page doesn't clear the login state.
